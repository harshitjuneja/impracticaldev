# Background and relationship with money
Middle class kids, kids of refugees, chilren of alcoholic parents, orphans or poeple who have had a single parent have had a harsh relationship with money in general, where they litreally see their parents grinding to keep the lights on. They are kids who are usually embarrased in class for not submitting their fee in time, compromise or struggle to go to that picnic. 

# Getting better and skewed relationships

It looks as if money is the one most important thing that is the solution of all their worries and hence, they end up having a complicated relationship with money. They either grow up hating the concept of money and those who possess it or otherwise end up wishing deeply and/or working endlessly in the pursuit of money. Most when finally have ensured their survival get confused in the status game and shift to the status game and would do anything that makes them feel wanted.

While this lust/hate relationship goes on, their is another set of junta amongst these who wander from these relationships and ask questions and build bridges towards understanding the nature of their relationship with money and how poeple with money hold a different relationship towards it than them. It's no less than a therapy when they understand that it's thier experiences which has made one's relation with money toxic. 

# Internet and the tech world

You'd see money is not the answer posts and trade experience for money all the time and this is no less than porn in the way it alters our mind and adds to the confusion. When you have seen your parents go through the struggle to make ends meed and now when you start developing every blue tick person on the internet wants you to not work for money but for contributing to world. It messes us your mind and adds to the confusion. You want to bring a dent to the world. You want to be the round peg in the square hole. You would sacrifice money for "learning" and comfort.
